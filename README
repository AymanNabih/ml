This is a personal project whose goal is to concentrate all my Python code
about Machine Learning.

You are completely free to use it anyway you want. However, it'd be cool
if I was notified... just to know that this is useful for someone else =).

Of course, use it without any warranty... at your own risk. I can't guarantee
complete documentation and stability. I make it stable and documented just
enough for my own purposes.

Also, any contribution (new algorithms and, particularly, tests) are welcome.
Send me a pull request or a patch and i'll be very happy to review it.

That's it. =)
