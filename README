This is a personal project whose goal is to concentrate all my Python code
about Machine Learning.

You are completely free to use it anyway you want. However, it'd be nice
if I was notified... just to know that this is useful for someone else =).

Of course, I don't guarantee anything. Use at your own risk. I can't
guarantee complete documentation and stability. I make it stable enough just
for my own purposes.

That's it =)
